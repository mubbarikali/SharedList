## Description of SharedList App:
```Just to give you an idea. This SharedList app is a MERN Stack app with React.js and React Native frontends.```

### Features:
- [x] Basic feature I want to implement is that a couple can do groceries easily by remaining on the same page with its synchronization of items features. 
- [x] It's a very simple app, it's just giving access to the same Item's List to a couple by Signing Up in it and sharing lists with each other. If a couple has shared a list with each other whenever any one of them will add an item i.e. Onion, Tomato etc it will go inside To-Buy and whenever any of them will swipe it left it will go down inside the Bought section.
- [x] It's a very simple app but it's a simple way to do grocery together or individually at different physical places for a couple but in real time both people will be aware of which item another spouse has already bought and which are remaining. Whenever an item is swiped left it will go to the Bought section down there.
- [x] And whenever an item will be swiped towards the right side it will be removed and go to removed items.
- [x] Another feature which a couple is, will be Frequently Bought Items and Text Autocomplete i.e. those items which a couple will be buying frequently will be added in their Frequently Bought Items category and whenever a user will try to add new item as soon as he/she will start writing name of item, autocomplete feature will give them suggestion of the complete words based on their History.
- [x] App will also keep record of history of bought items i.e. whenever a user will swipe left to on the item it will go inside bought section and automatically date will be append to it i.e. messages of a particular dates are arranged in one date in WhatsApp having their date mentioned above them only once.
